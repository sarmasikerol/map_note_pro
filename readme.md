# Map Note Application

This project is a map-based application that allows users to mark and save places like their home, workplace, or places they want to visit. Users can add notes to these marked locations and navigate directly to them on the map. The application uses `LocalStorage` for data persistence and the Leaflet library for map functionalities.

## Features

- **Mark Locations**: Users can mark locations such as home, work, or places of interest on the map.
- **Add Notes**: Add and save notes for each marked location.
- **Navigate to Location**: Quickly navigate to any marked location on the map.
- **Data Persistence**: Notes and marked locations are saved using `LocalStorage`, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.
- **Leaflet Integration**: The project uses the Leaflet library for interactive map features.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - For the structure of the application.
- **CSS** - For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** - For adding interactivity and managing `LocalStorage`.
- **Leaflet** - For rendering the interactive map.
